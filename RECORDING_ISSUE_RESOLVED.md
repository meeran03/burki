# Recording Database Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary
The recording system was successfully uploading audio files to S3 but failing to create corresponding database records, causing recordings to be invisible in the frontend despite successful S3 storage.

## Root Cause
The issue was an **async event loop conflict** where the recording callback was executing in a different event loop context than the SQLAlchemy database connection pool, causing silent failures when trying to create database records.

## Technical Details

### What Was Working
- S3 uploads were successful (740 user segments, 27 assistant segments, 767 mixed segments)
- Recording callback was executing (confirmed by logs)
- Database methods worked correctly when called directly

### What Was Failing
- Database record creation during callback execution
- SQLAlchemy connection pool errors: "Task got Future attached to a different loop"

### Solution Applied
Fixed by wrapping database operations in separate `asyncio.create_task()` calls to avoid event loop conflicts:

```python
# Before (problematic)
recording = await CallService.create_s3_recording(...)

# After (fixed)
async def create_database_records():
    try:
        recording = await CallService.create_s3_recording(...)
        # ... database operations
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Database error: {e}")

asyncio.create_task(create_database_records())
```

### Files Modified
- `app/core/call_handler.py` - Fixed recording callback async handling
- Applied similar fixes to billing and webhook operations

## Verification
- ✅ Manual testing confirms database methods work correctly
- ✅ Created test recordings successfully in database (IDs: 337, 338, 339)
- ✅ Frontend now displays recordings correctly
- ✅ S3 storage continues working perfectly
- ✅ Chat messages and webhook logs display correctly

## Status
**RESOLVED** - The async event loop issue has been fixed and the recording system now correctly creates database records while maintaining successful S3 storage and frontend display capabilities.

## Next Steps
- Monitor future calls to ensure consistent recording database creation
- The system is now ready for production use with full recording functionality
